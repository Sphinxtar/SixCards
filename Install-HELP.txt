 Upgraded to Fedora 34, getting my development environment going again was
 a little tricky so I elaborated and got real specific on these directions.
 Good luck and I hope this helps you get started with react-native.
$ mkdir myreactapps
$ cd myreactapps
$ npm init
 just answer the questions as follows and say (yes) to create package.json
	version: (1.0.0) 
	description: react native js apps
	entry point: (index.js) 
	test command: 
	git repository: https://github.com/urRepoName
	keywords: js, react-native
	author: ur mom
 now use npm to install all js packages we'll need to get started
$ npm install joi
$ npm install @babel/core@^7.13.0
$ npm install @babel/preset-env@^7.1.6
 npm install fsevents@2.3.2 (not required)
$ npm install react@17.0.1
$ npm install react-native
$ npm install react-native-safe-area-context@^3.1.9
$ npm install react-native-vector-icons@^7.0.0
$ npm install react-native-elements
$ npm install create-react-native-app
$ npm install react-refresh@^0.8.2
$ npm install expo-cli@4.4.3
$ npm audit
$ npm list
 Add all the tools installed to your path, maybe put it in your ~/.bashrc
$ export PATH=$PATH:`npm bin`

 from there you can call either one of the following 
 to initialize a react native app from a template
$ expo init yourProjectName --npm
$ npx create-react-native-app --use-npm
 and follow their directions output to begin developing.
 To run/play SixCards!:
 Download and unzip, copy just the img/ directory and images in it to
 your project directory. Overwrite App.js with either App.js for the web
 or SixCards.js for the Android version then to start the service and open it in your browser:
 $ expo start
